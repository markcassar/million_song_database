# million_song_database

This is an initial attempt to create what I am calling an 'emotibeat' score for songs. For songs in the MusicXMatch dataset 
and the Million Song Database I calculated the sentiment for the lyrics of each song and combined it with the song's tempo. I was 
exploring this score to see if the songs I looked at split into meaningful groups. Still much work to be done. Further extensions would 
be to include instrumentation of a song in some way, as I personally sometimes want a playlist with similar lyrical style, tempo, and 
instruments.
